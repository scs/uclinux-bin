uClinux binary Repository
=========================

Checkout
--------

In this repository we keep the final uClinux binaries for the leanXcam and the indXcam.

As of now (after some cleanup) we have the two branches "leanxcam" and "indxcam" (BE CAREFUL, the "x" in the middle is NOT capitalized, like it is in the tags!). To get the newest binary for one of them, do e.g.

$ git checkout leanxcam

For a specific version, you can look at the history with 

$ gitk --all

and then check out the version you want with something like

$ git checkout leanXcam/v2.1

New Release
-----------

To release a new version of either the leanXcam or the indXcam, first compile the uclinux.git repository and then use the "do-tag" script to create a new tag and HISTORY file.

Then checkout the branch you created the binary for, e.g.

$ git checkout leanxcam

Then copy the new uImage and HISTORY file into this folder, overwriting the old one.

Commit it

$ git commit -av

and create a new tag, containig first the branch name, then a "/v" and then the actual version according to SCS conventions, for example

$ git tag "leanXcam/v2.1-p1"

History
-------

Why are there so many roots in the repository?

The answer is, that earlyer the releases were created in a different way, with a do-checkout script etc... this was considered too complicated and abandoned.
So just ignore the old roots, work only in the "master", "leanXcam" and "leanXradio" branches and use the tags, if you need really old binaries.
